## Project Description


Login online, see user pictures and stuff, with a description.  Before logging in immediately, where you have to sign in before you see pictures, this one will let you still see pictures even if you don't log in.  You can see the pictures posted and click on them, etc., without needing to log in.  Sort of a pinterest/IG mashup.  STRETCH** Can people comment if they are not logged in? (Anonymous user thing?)  Each user would have their own page (like IG/Pinterest) and there would be a main feed STRETCH** with timestamped photos.

## Planning Process
Create wireframes for end-product image. Simple sites with pictures and usernames. Get RESTful/CRUD routes established.  Create database. Work on views.  Ensure data is displayed on pages properly with dummy data. Create database.  Create Schema for users/photos. Connect the database to the code. Test for the connection. Attach routes to the databse. Work on CSS. Make sure nothing breaks.
